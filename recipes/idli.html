        <li>
            <p>
                Heat vegetable oil in a pan over medium-low heat. Add mustard seeds, cumin seeds, and chana dal and
                saute for a few seconds.
                <br>
                Add curry leaves, dried red chile, cashews, ginger, green chile peppers, and hing and saute until cashew
                nuts turn slightly brown, 3 to 4 minutes.
                <br> Add semolina and cook and stir over low heat until slightly browned; remove mixture to a plate and
                let cool completely, about 10 minutes.

        <li>
            <p>
                Add yogurt and carrot to the mixture and mix well. Add water as needed to reach desired consistency.
                Season with salt to taste. Cover and let sit for 15 minutes. Check batter consistency again; add more
                water if needed.
